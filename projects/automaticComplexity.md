In addition to the typical high school electives such as art and foreign language, my high school offered courses in business, engineering, health careers, and natural resources. After taking business on a whim, I decided that I quite liked it and wanted to continue with it. While students in the engineering classes could enhance their learning by participating in robotics, the health career students in HOSA (Future Health Professionals, formerly Health Occupations Students of America), and natural resources students in Future Farmers of America (FFA), there was business club on campus. 

After a bit of Googling, I found out that there were business versions of HOSA and FFA, notably DECA (formerly Distributive Education Clubs of America) and FBLA (Future Business Leaders of America), which both allowed students to partake in various competitions. I approached a friend of mine who was also interested business to start DECA (FBLA doesn't have a Hawaii presence) with me, and we ended up spearheading many of the club's events. 

Through doing mock role-plays, selling various items for fundraisers, and learning about various areas in business from marketing communications to financial services (which my friend and I ended up going to Nationals for after placing first in our final year!), we improved our public speaking, persuasion, and collaboration skills. 

Here is the presentation from the Symposium: https://www.overleaf.com/read/rbdfttrwcfxw
