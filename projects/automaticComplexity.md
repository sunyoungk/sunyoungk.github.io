Automatic complexity 

Over this summer, I worked with Professor Kjos-Hanssen and a group of other students on automatic complexity research. Our aim was to find the lower bound of a string by finding patterns within it and tracking the number of repetitions. This also applies to the widely known Fibonacci words, as well as the lesser known Tribonacci words. It can also be used to demonstrate reduplication. 



The research process involved lots of discussion to ensure we understood the principles and theories, as well as how we were going to utilize and apply them to the research question.  

At the end of the summer, the other students and I presented our work at the Summer Undergraduate Research Symposium. The link to the slides is below.
