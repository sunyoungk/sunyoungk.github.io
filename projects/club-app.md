ICS 314 Software Engineering I culminates in a group project where students work together to build a web application using Meteor, React, JavaScript and the other tools and technologies taught in the class. My group named our app Manoa Club Hunt, and as its name applies, its intended purpose is to streamline the process of finding and hopefully partaking in clubs for UH Manoa students. 

My project contributions had to do with the club-related pages, the club profile with the club information and the edit club page that the admin and club officers can access. This involved being mindful about what may make sense for the users and the functionalities that they might need.

Working on this project was not only a test of understanding, connecting and applying the all ICS 314 materials and concepts, but in collaborating with others. Though people generally focused on certain parts of the project, sometimes getting one's part of the project to function involved making changes to someone else's part and comprehending their code.
