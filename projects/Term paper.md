Chamorro is the Austronesian language native to the Mariana Islands (Topping et al.
1975). Located in Micronesia, the 400-mile-long island chain lies east of the Philippines and
north of the Caroline Islands (Safford 1903). The word Chamorro comes from Chamorri or
Chamoli, which means 'chief.' The people indigenous to the Marianas are also referred to as
Chamorros; they call their native language Fino-liaya, or â€˜Idiom-of-the-south.' Today, there are
64,300 Chamorro speakers worldwide, with 30,300 of these speakers residing on Guam, the
southernmost island of the Mariana Islands (Ethnologue 2018).
