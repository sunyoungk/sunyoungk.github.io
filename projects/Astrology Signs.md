The final project for ICS 111 gave students a lot of freedom to do whatever our minds pleased, as long as it used EZ and two of the concepts taught in class. A classmate and I used file writing and reading to take in and record names, birthdates, and western astrological signs. This type of project was a suggestion I recalled from my high school computer programming class; many people have trouble keeping track of others' birthdays and astrological signs may be find useful to know for trivia purposes, but people seem to only know their own signs. 

The code is mostly if-statements, with each condition being the range of dates for one of the twelve signs, and running it returns and records the date-specifc sign. Though not intentional, the program was coded as a case sensitive one, in that months must be capitalized for a sign to be returned. This served as a reminder to keep aware of the specifications and capabilities of programming languages.

Here is the link to view the [video demonstration] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBccfS5yKjw) of the code.
