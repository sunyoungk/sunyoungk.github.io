The final project for ICS 111 gave students a lot of freedom to do whatever our minds pleased. A classmate and I used file writing and reading to take in and record names, birthdates, and astrological signs, since many people have trouble keeping track of others' birthdays.

The code is mostly if-statements, but it was coded to be case sensitive in that months must be capitalized for a sign to be returned. This served as a reminder to keep aware of the specifications and capabilities of programming languages.
