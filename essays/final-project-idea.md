## The Problem 

UH sends out *too many* weekly emails about what events are happening every week. For many students, these emails often go ignored, as there are too many listed, and students have to dig through the emails to find an event that they are interested in and fits their schedule.


## The Solution 

An application that allows students to input their preferences and their availability would recommend events that they *are* interested in and work with their schedule. This may increase student participation in campus events, and also save students (and their inboxes!) time and space.


## Mockup page ideas

Landing / All Events page
Register page
User home / Your Events page
User profile page (preferences and avilability will be added/edited here)
Specific Event / More Info on an Event pages


## Use case ideas

New users are directed to Landing, where all events are displayed, but at the top there is a registration/log in option.
Upon logging in, user is taken to User home, where user-specific events are listed. Existing users can update their preferences, while new users can input their interests. 

## Beyond the basics

This application could sync with social media apps so that users can see what events their friends may be attending. 
It could also include whether e.g. prior registration/ticket purchase is required.
