I think there is a reason "programming" is interchangeable with "writing code". The processes of writing code in formal languages and writing text in human languages are actually quite a lot alike. At the surface level, both involve typing, and share a lot of the same terminology such as syntax and grammars. However, more importantly, programming and writing in natural language both entail continuous revising and improving, much of which is governed by conventions or standards.  

## Breaking Away from the First Language
The first language I learned to program in was Java, but the first language that I learned was Korean. Although over thirteen years have passed since I came to the US and learned English, I still feel that much of the syntax I use is the same one used in Korean. I don't notice it too much when I'm talking, but I often find myself restructuring my sentences when I write, and I also tend to gravitate to Java syntax when writing code in ICS 314. JavaScript is the programming language we've been using in ICS 314 so far. It is similar to Java, but it's not the same.  

An alternative to that last sentence could be: "I don't notice it too much when I'm talking, but when I write or proofread my writing, I spend most of my time restructuring my sentences to follow the subject-verb-object order in English." These two sentence are virtually identical in terms of the words that they contain; the phrases are just rearranged in the second to convey the meaning more clearly. To further improve the sentence, I could've eliminate the adverbs "too much"; they don't change the meaning of the sentence, they just make it a little longer. 

## I Won't Readily Admit to Being a STEM Person

Thinking back on this after reading Newport's book made me wonder that I would major in computer science in college, even though I virtually had no idea what computer science was at that time. My assumption was that it would be similar to math, which I've tended to find math the easiest (not anymore), but more easily applied to other fields. This latter part was attractive to me because I've generally found social studies courses the most meaningful throughout my education. As for math, Discrete Math 301 last spring definitely changed my view on math in that "real" math doesn't involve much plugging and chugging.

I'll be honest: Computer science courses haven't been among my favorite classes until this semester. What kept me wanting to pursue it further was the discussion of language in computing in 111, which got me interested in doing something that blends computer science and the humanities. In the meantime, I'll aim to develop my skills and expand my knowledge in 314.
