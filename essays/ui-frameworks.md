"Computer scientists are only second in laziness to mathematicians."
 
This from a conversation I had with a classmate in ICS 211. I asked him how finished the assignments so quickly, and he had told me that he had code from high school to go off of, before saying that computer science people just reuse their code (unless it is necessary to write new code), while mathematicians create new math if things don't fit. 

## More Work is Inevitable
As a lazy computer science major who would be studying math if she weren't doing CS, I have done the same in looking back at previous materials in an effort to do less work for the assignment I was currently working on. But, I have also done more work while trying to do less work. An assignment in my Computational Modeling class required me to decrpyt a message. We had done this by hand in class by counting the number of occurrences each letter (for all 26 letters!!!) appeared in the text. Although it wasn't as tedious or time consuming as I anticipated it would be, it was rather boring and mildly mind numbing, and none of anyone's counts were totally accurate. Not wanting to do this again, I decided I was going to write a program to do it for me. I spent an embarrassing amount of time (as in a few hours) writing 26 if-statements for my code to not work. Instead of replacing letters according to how often they appear, I was supposed to have replaced each letter with one that is seven letters behind it.
